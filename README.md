What's This All About?
Hey there! This is SimulationEngine, the brain behind the population predictions in the Populion app. Think of it as the keeper of the simulation's "rules" and the crystal ball that peers into the future (well, sort of!).

This specific version is lean and mean, focused only on:

Holding onto the settings you choose (like starting populations, fertility rates, life expectancy for each group).
Doing the core math to figure out how populations might change month-to-month based on those settings (births minus deaths!).
Running a quick, behind-the-scenes calculation to predict what the populations might look like on a future date you pick.
Loading your saved simulation scenarios so you can easily switch between different setups.
It uses SwiftUI's ObservableObject magic so the app's interface stays updated when settings change.

What It Does (The Cool Parts!) 
Keeps Settings: Stores your global SimulationParameters and the specific GroupSettings for up to 10 groups.
Core Math (calculateNextPopulationState): This private function is where the monthly magic happens. It takes the current population and, using your settings, figures out roughly how many people are born and how many pass away in each group for that month.
Prediction Power (predictPopulation): This is the star! You give it a future date, and it rapidly runs the core math month-by-month (without showing every step) to give you an estimate of the population breakdown on that date. Super handy for "what if" scenarios!
Loads Saved Games: Remembers your saved simulation profiles using loadProfiles() and loadSelectedProfile().
The Secret Sauce (How Calculations Work - Simplified!) 
Okay, real talk: simulating populations accurately is hard. This engine uses a simplified model:

Deaths: Looks at the average life expectancy for a group â€“ longer life means fewer deaths each month (on average).
Births: Estimates how many women are likely in child-bearing age and could be married (based on your settings like TFR, marriage age, max wives, % not marrying). It then calculates births based on the average number of children per woman (TFR).
No Age Groups: It treats everyone in a group the same way regarding birth/death rates (doesn't track 20-year-olds vs 60-year-olds specifically). This is a big simplification!
No Moving: Doesn't account for people moving in or out (migration).
Basic Marriage: Uses a simple model for pairing people within a group.
Result: The predictions are fun estimates based on the rules you set, great for seeing trends, but not precise demographic forecasts!

How It Fits In 
This engine is usually created once when the app starts (like a @StateObject). Other views in the app watch it (@ObservedObject) to display settings, show prediction results, and allow you to change the parameters.

Future Fun? (Potential Upgrades) 
Age Structure: Adding age groups would make it way more realistic (but also more complex!).
Migration: Letting people move between groups or in/out of the simulation.
Smarter Marriage: Modeling who marries whom more dynamically.
Async Prediction: Making super long-range predictions run in the background so the app doesn't freeze.
Hope this gives you a good feel for what SimulationEngine.swift does in its current form!
